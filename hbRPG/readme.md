# Todo 
- Proper death effects for bushes, leaves    
  why create new effects instance  
  why not just make an AnimatedSprite inside, shows it when death -> because it will cause collision glitch 
- Bat AI 

# Done 
- Animation tree for state 
  attack 
  roll 
-> This was hard to sync AnimTree with the code,
- Stats management: 
  Resource or JSON  
-> JSON can be edited without Godot   
  but JSON slower when devel (need reload, config outside)



# Refractor
- Inherited Level 
- Inherited Enemies
